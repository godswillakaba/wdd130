                Hello! My name is Godswill Akaba and I am from Cape Coast, Ghana. I am a dedicated student at BYU-Idaho, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Development. I have developed a strong foundation in programming through courses like Introduction to Programming and Programming with Functions. Additionally, I hold a Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, which has equipped me with skills in data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and storytelling using tools like Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau, and Python.  
                With a passion for data analysis and web development, I aspire to combine these skills to build innovative solutions that drive informed decision-making and create impactful user experiences. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, with the goal of becoming an expert in both fields and making meaningful contributions to the tech industry.
